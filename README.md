# Algorithms-Part-I-Coursera-PU

## Syllabus

__Description.__ An introduction to fundamental data types, algorithms, and data structures. Our emphasis is on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations.

This Part focuses on elementary data structures, sorting, and searching. Topics include union−find, binary search, stacks, queues, bags, insertion sort, selection sort, shellsort, quicksort, 3-way quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, binary heaps, binary search trees, red−black trees, separate-chaining and linear-probing hash tables, Graham scan, and kd-trees.

__Prerequisites.__ The programming prerequisite for the course is familiarity with Java, including loops, arrays, functions, recursion, and objects. We introduce advanced features of Java as necessary (such as generics and iterators).

__Programming Assignments.__ Some of the programming assignments require that you implement a data structure or algorithm from scratch; others require that you apply a data structure or algorithm to solve a problem from science, commerce, or recreation. We expect that each programming assignment will take approximately 4–20 hours to complete, depending on your programming experience and how far beyond the basic performance requirements you wish to go. You may attempt each programming assignment up to 10 times (your best score is recorded). After each attempt, we will provide feedback on correctness and efficiency.

For each assignment, there will be a folder which contains: the instructions, my submission, and the feedback received. Each submission got a score greater than or equal to the minimum score to pass, which is 80/100.
